##Everyday is a learning day !


Normally, before we move directly to databases, you guys have to learn basic opeartions of PHP. These operations known to be "CRUD". CRUD stands for **Create, Read, Update and Delete(CRUD)**. This repository will help you to put your hands together in learning basic PHP CRUD opeartions.	


This repository gives you the knowledge of,
	
	..*Creating Records
	..*Selecting Records
	..*Updating Records
	..*Deleting Records

The technologies I've used : 
	..* PHP
	..*Bootstrap
	..*HTML
	..*XAMMP Server
	..*MySQL
	..*Text Editior - Visual Studio Code

Before, you work on this , you have to install the new version of the XAMPP server and the MySQL server.
