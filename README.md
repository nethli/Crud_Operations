## Everyday is a learning day !

Normally, before we move directly to databases, you guys have to learn basic opeartions of PHP. These operations known to be "CRUD". **CRUD** stands for **_Create, Read, Update and Delete(CRUD)_**. This repository will help you to put your hands together in learning basic PHP CRUD opeartions.	


This repository gives you the knowledge of,

- Creating Records
- Selecting Records
- Updating Records
- Deleting Records

The technologies I've used : 
- PHP
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- XAMMP Server
- MySQL
- Text Editior - Visual Studio Code

Before, you work on this , you have to install the new version of the XAMPP server and the MySQL server.

1. [XAMPP Server](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
2. [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)


And I've used some bootsrap codes in my project. You can get the bootsrap codes through the following link :
